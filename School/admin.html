    <h2>OGUN OLAKUNLE OLUWATOBI</h2>
    <h3>It is an honour to write about my alma mater, Praise Nursery and Primary School, Akinyemi way, Ring road, Ibadan, in retrospect.</h3>
    <h3>A Journey that is a part of my first decade of existence is about to be summarized in a piece.</h3>
    <h3>She is a citadel of knowledge that teachers not only academics but also morals and salient life principle for survival in any region of the world.
        Her tutelage formed the genesis of any formal scientific, managerial, social and even musical skills i ever possessed. Crude as it mat seem, it is the bedrock of any polished dexterity i now have.</h3>
    <h3>I graduated from this great educational institution in the year 2000. Some of my colleagues were Uche Nwogu, Ayodele Balogun, Opeyemi Olowu etc, whom i have not seen since graduation.</h3>
    <h3>Time will fail me to tell of the fun times and hard times and times i had as a pupil, but these experiences added to my resilience in life.</h3>
    <h3>Long live the stronghold of knowledge.</h3>
    <h3>Up School!!!</h3>

        <h2>OGUN GBEMISOLA</h2>
        <h3>My name is Ogun Gbemisola. I was a pupil of Praise School, Akinyemi Way, Ring Road, Ibadan. I left the School 1995-1996 Session. My stay in the school was so interesting and full of fun as we had godly teachers who imparted us with excellent knowledge.
            My wonderful Music teacher, Mr. Sola taught me well that I still recall his teaching on poco-a-poco meaning little-by-little in Music. It was fun being in Music class.</h3>
        <h3>Aunty Tosin, a tall, dark woman brought our heart to God whenever she leads the assembly. We sing beautiful songs from our Songs of Praise (SOP) one of which is Hymn 444 "All thing bright and beautiful".</h3>
        <h3>I recall a day one of my classmates, Olawale Ojo, who loves eating beans so much was scolded by our teacher for eating with his hands. The teacher had gone to look for a spoon for him only to return and discover he had devoured the food with a wooden yellow ruler.
            We all laughed as he was punished for his bad habit by the teacher.</h3>
        <h3>Hardwork was one of the virtues instilled in us. We were drilled through various exercises from Apitude textbook. You can't be in Praise School and be a lazy pupil. One of the favourite quotations of my class teacher was "Hardwork doesn't kill". How then can I ever forget My Alma Mata Where I was trained to be who I am today? </h3>
        <h3>Mummy School was the name we gave to Our Proprietress. Mrs Phebe Olulode. She was a disciplinarian and an Instrument used by God to build several lives from littleness to what we have transformed to be today.
            She really cared for us even when our parents had forgotten us in School. We are always happy when our parents pick us late on rainy days. Mummy School would say 'Aunty Rachel, <span>awon omo wo lo ku sibe yen?</span> Bring them upstairs'. She'll care for us and make tea for us before our parents came. God bless you ma. My experience in praise, School was so wide that I can't finish sharing in this piece.</h3>
        <h3>I recall the day I broke my incisors. It was a Friday and I was dressed in the blue and white sportwear. I collided with a boy who was running from the primary section and I hit my face on the ground. I received quick medical care at The Vine Hospital. I recall these memories with appreciation to all that was done to build us into responsible adults at Praise School,Akinyemi Way, No doubt, the school has contributed its quota in building future leaders.</h3>
